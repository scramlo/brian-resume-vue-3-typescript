      Hi, I’m Brian and I solve puzzles for people. As both an
      enterprise-experienced developer and seasoned freelancer, my passion is
      helping people encounter an “ahhh” feeling while using software. However,
      an experience like this does not happen accidentally. It is through clear
      specs, accessible UX, clean code, and solid testing we create the most
      pleasing products possible. This is where I can add value to your team.
