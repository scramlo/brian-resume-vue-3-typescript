      "In 2016, the Scramlin family took our first lead pastoring position. New Journey Community Church was a six-year-old church plant seeking a leader with a balance between start-up charisma and long-range strategic planning. In only four years, I led the church in an increase of 20% attendance, growing the budget over 64%, and completed $250,000 in renovations. My heart for scalable, sustainable solutions led me to develop eight departments and heads, each overseeing ministry teams and leaders, who in turn oversee scores of volunteers. Most importantly, we have seen lives change. The hurting, addicted, de-churched, un-churched, disabled, and ashamed have found healing through our efforts. We give God the credit.",

I enjoyed the privilege of leading strategy and implementation teams for Discipleship, Connections, and Leadership, in addition to preaching on a rotation with our senior pastor. By inspiring, developing, and mobilizing the congregation and 85+ volunteers we witnessed a great deal of new fruitâ€”especially in the outreach focus of this church!",
